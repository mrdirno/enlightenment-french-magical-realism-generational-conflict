  "cover_prompt": "A single, ornate wooden drawer stands slightly ajar in the dusty wall of a grand, forgotten hallway, its contents not of objects but of softly glowing, swirling whispers made visible, which drift like ethereal smoke into the corridor's still air. The scene is set within the intricate, decaying elegance of a French Enlightenment-era manor house, where peeling wallpaper reveals older patterns beneath and the very architecture—cracked cornices, a faded mural of a pastoral scene, a solitary empty chair—seems to hold its breath, charged with unspoken family history. In the atmospheric style of Remedios Varo, blending precise, symbolic detail with a haunting, magical realism that feels both scientific and deeply mystical. Book cover framing, centered composition with a dramatic low-angle shot looking down the endless hallway, the open drawer a focal point of eerie emission. Chiaroscuro lighting with a single shaft of dusty, late-afternoon sun cutting through the gloom, illuminating the motes of dust and spectral whispers, color palette of aged sepia, muted gold, deep charcoal, and the faint, spectral blue of the escaping memories. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
