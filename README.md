## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter where the house speaks through a new object (a mirror, a hearth, a child's toy) to reveal a family secret it has kept for decades.
- Create a scene where Épiphane's mother finally hears the house speak. What does it say to her, and through what medium?
- Write a 'memory' from the house's perspective, recounting a pivotal, emotionally charged day in the family's history that no human witnessed in full.
- Draft a conversation between the house and the feral garden. What do these two sentient spaces argue about or collaborate on?

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'House Whisper' interactive map: a web-based interface where users can click on rooms/objects in a blueprint of the house to read/hear fragments of its memory.
- Create a 'Generational Lexicon' generator: a tool that analyzes text for thematic conflict between 'order' and 'accumulation,' tagging dialogue and description with these opposing forces.
